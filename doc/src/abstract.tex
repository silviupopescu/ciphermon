There are several layers of analysis and isolation in the Android application
environment, all develope with the explicit purpose of ensuring that the
features of smartphones do not expose personal user information to malicious
third parties. While the current set of barriers covers many attack vectors,
the solutions are limited if the malware is delivered to the victim device as
a seemingly inoffensive file only to be transformed using cryptographic
primitives into a malicious application package. Since the
transformation is done on the victim device, most safeguards are bypassed. We
propose a system that detects tentative attacks which use the above mentioned
approach by instrumenting the cryptographic primitives in order to
detect if both input and output are valid files.
