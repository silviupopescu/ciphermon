Although not through a completely automated process, we 
managed to provide a Proof-of-Concept setting for succesfully 
detecting whether a suspicious application encodes/decodes 
malicious information to be used on our phone and stopping
that application from executing its task.

Amongst our future work, we consider an automation of the hooking 
process by injecting Zygote, the Android daemon process 
that is responsible for launching new applications, to bypass 
manual hooking. Additionally, the removal of the need for root access 
of the phone is a priority feature, since it consists a barrier for interested
userd.

We also want to extend the current application to monitor not 
only one application but every application that is newly installed
 by the user as well as any combination of possibly encode/decode
 file formats to increase awareness regarding malicious applications.
